This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Initial build created dollar amounts on screen to toggle  onClick for Jeopardy through questions and answers.
In the interest of experimentation I customized data to representatives and twitter ids ans also passed a default emoji for kicks.

Demonstrates some of the basic things in a React app:
* setState
* rendering
* using a Component
* passing props
* mapping to a div
